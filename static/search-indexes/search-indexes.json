This self-hosted deployment model gives you complete control over the application. Before you begin deployment, understand the application architecture so you can prepare your environment. The Metadata Capture application is a modular platform that integrates several components to enable secure, scalable dataset management. The following figure illustrates the high-level architecture of the system. Metadata Capture integrates with your organisational infrastructure and is designed for flexible deployment. Here’s what you need to know before you begin deployment: - Core application: The Metadata Capture application includes both a frontend (user interface) and backend services, designed to run on your infrastructure. Your users interact with the system through their web browser, which communicates directly with the application. - Authentication & access control: The application relies on an external OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to manage authentication and user permissions. Your organisation must have its own Identity and Access Management (IAM) system, which controls access and role assignments within Metadata Capture. - Centralised database: Metadata Capture stores and retrieves all application data using a PostgreSQL database. Your organisation must provide its own PostgreSQL instance and grant Metadata Capture secure access to the database. - Email notifications: Metadata Capture includes a notification feature that sends emails to relevant users during key events of the dataset lifecycle. For example, it sends an email when a dataset is submitted for validation, or when it is approved for publication. Your organisation must configure its own SMTP server to deliver these notifications. Now that you understand the architecture, you can prepare your environment and deploy the Metadata Capture application.",

Everything you see in the dashboard is specific to the organisation you select and the roles assigned to you within that organisation. The dashboard has the following components: - Filters panel (left): Filter datasets based on key crieteria defined when the dataset was created. - Datasets panel (right): Manage datasets throughout their lifecycle. - Search bar (top of datasets panel): Search datasets by any keyword or phrase. Filter and search Use the filters and search to find datasets quickly. Datasets are displayed based on the filters you apply and the search terms you enter. :::tip Combine filters and search Use filters and search together to progressively refine your results. For example, if you search for \"transport\", you'll see all datasets related to transport. Then, if you apply a Keyword filter, you'll find datasets related to transport that are tagged with the keyword. ::: Dataset panel The dataset panel is where you view and manage dataset metadata throughout their lifecycle. Your access to metadata in this panel and their available actions depend on the role assigned to you and the organisation you are currently viewing. Datasets are displayed in tabs, each representing a stage in the dataset lifecycle: - Draft: Datasets that have been added or are being edited. - Completed: Datasets that are ready for review and validation. - Validated: Datasets that have been reviewed and are awaiting approval. - Approved: Datasets that have been approved and are ready for publication. - Published: Datasets that are live and accessible to all organisations. - Internal Only: Datasets that are live and accessible within your organisation. - Deprecated: Datasets that are no longer in use or have been replaced by newer versions.

This self-hosted deployment model gives you complete control over the application. Before you begin deployment, understand the application architecture so you can prepare your environment. The Metadata Capture application is a modular platform that integrates several components to enable secure, scalable dataset management. The following figure illustrates the high-level architecture of the system. Metadata Capture integrates with your organisational infrastructure and is designed for flexible deployment. Here’s what you need to know before you begin deployment: - Core application: The Metadata Capture application includes both a frontend (user interface) and backend services, designed to run on your infrastructure. Your users interact with the system through their web browser, which communicates directly with the application. - Authentication & access control: The application relies on an external OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to manage authentication and user permissions. Your organisation must have its own Identity and Access Management (IAM) system, which controls access and role assignments within Metadata Capture. - Centralised database: Metadata Capture stores and retrieves all application data using a PostgreSQL database. Your organisation must provide its own PostgreSQL instance and grant Metadata Capture secure access to the database. - Email notifications: Metadata Capture includes a notification feature that sends emails to relevant users during key events of the dataset lifecycle. For example, it sends an email when a dataset is submitted for validation, or when it is approved for publication. Your organisation must configure its own SMTP server to deliver these notifications. Now that you understand the architecture, you can prepare your environment and deploy the Metadata Capture application.",

Users without these minimum permissions will receive a \"403 Forbidden\" error when accessing the application. ::: 3. Configure the role mapping path: Specify where roles appear in JWT tokens.
