## Catalogue Manager

The **Catalogue Manager** is a representative of the Ministry for Digitalisation or an authorized sub-contractor who serves as the system-wide administrator of the platform. Officially granted the authority to manage the public-facing portal, they oversee dataset governance across all organisations. This role ensures consistency and quality throughout the metadata ecosystem by operating across three key areas:

- **User management:** They establish the organizational foundation by assigning **Inventory Coordinators** in each organisation, who then manage role assignments within their teams.
- **Publication control:** They have exclusive authority to publish approved metadata records to the public-facing portal, as well as unpublish or deprecate records when necessary.
- **Vocabulary management:** They maintain system-wide standards by managing authentic source labels and controlled vocabularies (keywords, legal basis, organisations), ensuring consistent terminology across the platform.
