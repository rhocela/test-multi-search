# What is a dataset?

Metadata Capture is designed around the concepts of **metadata**, catalogued as **datasets**, and **data lifecycle management**.  These concepts shape your interactions within Metadata Capture.

## What is metadata?

**Metadata** is information that describes data. Metadata can be found in all types of data or resource, and different types of data can have different metadata. For example, a video file may have metadata that includes the *duration*, *resolution*, and *creation date*. A text document may have metadata such as the *author*, *file size*, and *last modified date*.

## What is a dataset?

In the context of Metadata Capture, a **dataset** is a catalogued record of metadata that is structured according to the <u>DCAT-AP-LU standards</u>. Key properties of the DCAT-AP-LU standard include the publisher, keywords, access rights, version, and more.

:::tip Know your terms

Think of **metadata** as a set of details that describes your data, while a **dataset** in Metadata Capture is a record of this metadata, structured in compliance with <u>DCAT-AP-LU</u>.

## Why are datasets important?

Organisations in all domains—such as in health, environment, and government—need access to accurate and comprehensive data for research, policy making, decision making, and other purposes. For example, a dataset on *Luxembourg Population* may include age, nationality, and other information needed for social services planning. A dataset on *Covid-19 Cases* may include vaccination rates, hospitalisations, and other statistics needed for public health responses.

To share and reuse these data effectively, <u>data holders</u> must provide clear and compliant **datasets** (metadata records) that accurately describe the data they hold.

## Data holders and data consumers

**Data holders (or data providers)** are organisations or entities that collect actual data directly from sources. For example, a *hospital* may collect health information directly from a patient, or the *Ministry of Finance* may collect economic data from businesses. In these examples, both the *hospital* and the *Ministry of Finance* are data holders. 

As a data holder, you are responsible for maintaining and disseminating data within your domain. You may also consume data from other data holders to gain insights.

## The role of Metadata Capture

**Metadata Capture** acts as a bridge between data holders and data consumers. It enables data holders to create and publish well-structured datasets or metadata records—without accessing the underlying data—ensuring information is documented, discoverable, and shared with data consumers in line with data governance and compliance.

## Managing datasets 

Each dataset in Metadata Capture is unique to its subject and managed independently. Metadata Capture enables you to update, version, or retire datasets as your data changes, supporting the full <u>dataset lifecycle</u>.
